Congratulations! You're a maintainer of the translation.

We setup some things for you.

1. There's a team `translate-<lang-code>` that includes all maintainers. 
    - You can add people there by making a PR to `langs/<lang-code>.json`.
    - You can notify all translators by mentioning the team, e.g. `@translate-en`.

2. Guess, you want other people to join you?

       - And you label it in the issue.
